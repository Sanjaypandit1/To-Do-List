# TaskFlow - To-Do List App 📝

TaskFlow is a modern, cross-platform to-do list application built with React Native that helps you organize your tasks efficiently with categories, notifications, and a clean interface.


## Features ✨

- ✅ **Task Management**: Create, complete, and delete tasks
- 🗂️ **Categories**: Organize tasks into Work, Personal, Shopping, Health, and Others
- 🔔 **Notifications**: Get progress updates and completion alerts
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators
- 🔐 **User Accounts**: Guest mode or authenticated users
- 💾 **Offline Storage**: Tasks persist locally on your device


> 📝 **Technical Choices Explained**  
I chose **React Native** because it allows building cross-platform apps with a single codebase, reducing development time and maintenance effort.  **npm/yarn** streamline installation processes. For Android, **Android Studio** was selected since it integrates all the necessary tools (SDK, AVD, Gradle) for testing and building reliable APKs.
